# Magic: The Gathering Deck Builder

#### By **Nathan Conn, Nicholas Sullivan, Chris DePastene, Erin McCulley, Amber Wilwand**

#### This program was designed to build different tyeps of decks that could be stored in a local database and assigned to a user's profile. 


## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET 5.0
* MVC
* Scryfall API



## Description

The program will make an API call to the Scryfall API and look up a card based on a part of or the whole name, a color identity, and/or the type of spell you are looking to add to your deck. The search results will yield all possible matches and display the mana cost, the set it was first published in, and the type of spell it is. The details page will display when the user clicks on a name and will be able to see what play formats it is allowed in and the prices for each type of card between the US and Europe.
